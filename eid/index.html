                <h1>Eid al-Fitr</h1>
                <p>Eid, also known as Eid al-Fitr or Eid ul-Fitr, is one of the most significant Islamic festivals celebrated
                 by Muslims worldwide. It marks the conclusion of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting and spiritual reflection. 
                 Eid is a joyous occasion characterized by communal prayers, feasting, and the exchange of gifts among family 
                 and friends. Central to the celebration is the act of giving to those in need through the obligatory charity 
                 known as "Zakat al-Fitr," ensuring that all Muslims can partake in the festivities. The festival is a time of 
                 unity, gratitude, and renewal of faith, as Muslims come together to express their devotion to Allah and strengthen 
                 their bonds with loved ones, fostering a sense of compassion, empathy, and shared joy.
